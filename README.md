## grblHAL driver for STM32F3xx processors

See the Wiki-page for [compiling grblHAL](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/wiki/Compiling-GrblHAL) for instructions for how to import the project, configure the driver and compile.

__NOTE:__ This is an initial version, currently only bench tested with an oscillocope using a [F303 Blackpill board](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f303cct6-256-kb-flash-stm32-arm-cortexr-m4-mini-system-dev-board-3326a9dd-3c19-11e9-910a-901b0ebb3621.html).

The F303 Blackpill board is electrically _and_ pin number compatible with F103 based *pills.  
It is _**not**_ pin function compatible and thus cannot always be used as a drop-in replacement for F103 based *pills.  
Notably routing I2C2 SDA/SCL signals to PB10/PB11 is not possible. The F303 based Blackpill cannot be used as a replacement for breakout boards needing these pins for I2C communication. 

The F303 should be preferred over F103 for grblHAL use as it has a FPU and plenty of RAM \(48K vs 20K\) and flash \(256K vs 128K\).  
It is also a safer alternative for grblHAL as the F103 is at the edge of beeing usable, e.g. adding plugins is not always possible due to memory limitations.
